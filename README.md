# Reference-Projects
These projects show the basics of web and app design. I use them as references. May they serve you well.

The HTML and CSS folder currently has two projects. Each is commented.
The Code School project was a front end design tutorial by Dan Denney.
It shows the basic principles of front end design using  HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The second tuorial is an HTML and CSS website by Jordan Hudgens on youtube. It is a good tutorial for 
creating a more professional look. It's great for learning how to use flexbox. This is my finished project.
I encourage you to watch the video and try it for yourself. The project files are in the video discription.

The react native folder shows the fundementals of creating apps using the framework.
They all were made using functional components instead of class components. I 
just felt functional components were easier to learn from. Each of These projects 
except one can be found in the react native documentation with slight
differences. It was better for me to have them all in one place. They are all 
extensively commented to show the in's and out's of react native. The Touchable Highlight
project is from a book called "Learning React Native" by Bonnie Eisenman. It's a good 
example of how to create a customized button if the buttons in react native might not 
suit your needs. To be able to use these files you must have a basic understanding of 
react native. You should look a the getting started section of the documentation.
